## About the Project
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page2.png)

This project analyzes UrbanCart’s sales data using SQL to uncover actionable business insights related to revenue performance, product trends, and customer purchasing behavior. By querying transactional and dimensional data from tables such as fact_order, fact_order_items, dim_products, and dim_customers for the period from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2025, the analysis explores key questions including revenue distribution, top-performing and underperforming products, frequently purchased product combinations, customer ordering patterns, and drivers of order value. The objective is to evaluate overall sales performance, identify top products and customers, recognize emerging trends, and support data-driven business decision-making through insights on revenue, order quantity, and transaction patterns

**Discussion:**  
The ER diagram illustrates the database structure of the system by showing the main entities and their relationships. It includes entities such as Customers, Orders, Order_Items, and Products, where each entity represents a table in the database. The relationships indicate how customers place orders and how each order consists of multiple products. Primary keys uniquely identify each record, while foreign keys are used to maintain relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy.

### 1. Order Distribution
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page4.png)

**Discussion:**  
Order Summary (September 30, 2025 – October 1, 2025)
During this period, UrbanCart recorded a total of 1,200 orders. Among them, 713 orders were successfully completed. The remaining 487 orders were not completed, with 241 orders still in a pending state and the rest having been cancelled.

### 2-3. Number of unique custoemrs & city wise order status
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page5.png)

**Discussion:**  
During this period, 100 unique customers placed orders on UrbanCart. Out of the 1,200 total orders, Barishal recorded the highest number (173), followed by Sylhet (148) and Chattogram (140), while the remaining orders were distributed across other cities.

### 4-5. The percentage of customers have placed more than one order &  Monthly trend of total orders over time
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page6.png)

**Discussion:**  
The analysis indicates that all customers placed more than one order, reflecting a fully repeat-customer base and suggesting strong customer retention during the period. This behavior implies consistent engagement and satisfaction with the platform. However, the order volume trend shows a peak in October, followed by a slight decline in November and a more noticeable drop in December. This downward pattern may be influenced by seasonal effects, changing customer demand, or reduced promotional activity toward the end of the year, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to sustain order volume in later months.

### 6.The total revenue generated by UrbanCart 
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page7.png)

**Discussion:**
The analysis shows that UrbanCart generated a total revenue of 1,353,914 Taka from completed orders, providing a reliable measure of realized sales performance. By excluding pending and cancelled orders, this figure reflects actual cash-generating transactions. However, if all currently pending orders are successfully completed, total revenue is projected to rise to 1,789,715 Taka, indicating a substantial potential upside. This gap highlights the importance of efficient order fulfillment and follow-up processes, as converting pending orders into completed ones could significantly boost overall revenue without acquiring new customers.

---
### 7. Product categories that contribute the most to total revenue.
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page8.png)

**Discussion:**
The chart highlights that the Fashion category is the top revenue generator for UrbanCart. This indicates that clothing, accessories, and related fashion items are the most popular and profitable products among customers. Several factors could explain this: fashion products often have higher price points compared to everyday items, frequent seasonal demand, and potential for upselling (e.g., matching items or bundles).

Following Fashion, Grocery and Electronics are the next highest revenue contributors. Grocery’s strong performance suggests high purchase frequency, as essential items are bought regularly. Electronics likely generate significant revenue due to higher individual product prices, even if purchase frequency is lower than groceries.

It’s important to note that this analysis considers only completed orders, which excludes canceled or returned orders. Therefore, the revenue figures reflect actual sales successfully processed rather than potential demand. This distinction is critical for decision-making, as it ensures the insights are grounded in real, realized revenue.

### 8. Individual products  wise  revenue :
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page9.png)

**Discussion:**
he SQL query focuses on product-wise revenue, highlighting the top 15 products in terms of sales. According to the results, Power Bank (1000 mAh) leads in revenue generation, followed by Nazir Shali Rice (500 kg) and Horlicks (500 g). This suggests that both electronics and essential goods are major contributors to UrbanCart’s sales, reflecting a diverse revenue stream across different product types.

By identifying these top-performing products, the analysis provides insight into key revenue drivers, helping the business understand which items significantly impact overall sales. This information is valuable for inventory management, marketing strategies, and promotional planning. For example, ensuring these products are always in stock, offering bundle deals, or highlighting them in advertisements could further enhance revenue.

Additionally, focusing on top revenue-generating products allows the business to allocate resources efficiently, prioritizing high-impact items to maximize profitability.

### 9. The average order value (AOV) and Average Basket Size :
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page10.png)

**Discussion:**
Considering only completed orders, the average order value (AOV) is 1,899 Taka, with an average basket size of approximately 10 items per order. Including both completed and pending orders, the AOV slightly decreases to 1,876 Taka, while the basket size remains around 10 items. This indicates that customers typically purchase multiple products per order, generating substantial revenue per transaction. These insights can help guide marketing strategies, pricing, and inventory management.

</p>

**Discussion:**
The chart shows the stock-to-sales ratio to evaluate the risk of stock-outs for products. A ratio between 0.2 and 0.5 indicates a high risk, with Power Bank (1000 mAh) falling in this range, making it the most vulnerable product. Products with a ratio between 0.5 and 1 are at medium risk, including Wallet, Horlicks (500 g), and Bru Coffee (200 g). Products with a ratio above 1 are considered low risk.

</p>

**Discussion:**
The average basket size for UrbanCart is 10, meaning that, on average, each order contains 10 units of products. This indicates that customers tend to purchase multiple items per transaction, providing opportunities for cross-selling and bundled offers.

**Customer Purchase Patterns by Gender:**
The analysis shows that male customers purchase more products than female customers across multiple categories, including Grocery, Fashion, Personal Care, Digital, Home Care, Electronics, Dairy, Beverages, Snacks, and Meat. Specifically, males purchase more than females in Grocery, Fashion, Personal Care, Digital, and Home Care, with the difference increasing in that order. This insight can help tailor marketing strategies and promotions for different customer segments.

### 14. The cities which have the highest average order value
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page16.png)

**Discussion:**
The analysis shows that Rajshahi generates the highest average order value (AOV), followed by Cumilla and Narayanganj, considering all orders (completed, pending, and cancelled). In contrast, Sylhet and Dhaka record the lowest AOV.

### 15. The way customer purchasing behavior change over time since account creation
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page17.png)

**Customer Retention Analysis:**
The query tracks customer arrivals over the first three months after account creation. Customers are grouped by their account creation date, and the number of returning customers is counted for each subsequent month.

For example, customers who created an account on 2025-09-14 had 12 out of 13 arrivals in the first month, all 13 in the second month, and 8 in the third month. Similar patterns are observed for other account creation dates, showing how many new customers return in the following months.

This analysis helps understand customer retention trends and identify periods where engagement may drop, providing insights for targeted marketing, follow-up campaigns, or loyalty initiatives to improve long-term customer retention.

### 16. The payment methods are used most frequently
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page18.png)

**Discussion:**
The analysis of completed orders shows that Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most popular payment method, with 391 orders, followed by Bkash (276 orders) and Nagad (188 orders). Credit Card (54 orders) and Debit Card (45 orders) are the least used payment methods. Cancelled orders are excluded from this analysis.

---
### 17. Relation between payment method and order status:
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page19.png)

**Discussion:**
The clustered column chart shows that Cash on Delivery (COD) has the highest number of completed orders (391), but it also exhibits a large number of cancelled orders. A similar trend is seen for Bkash (276 orders) and Nagad (188 orders), although these have relatively balanced proportions of completed, cancelled, and pending orders.

This suggests a potential relationship between payment method and order status, with COD being associated with more cancellations. To confirm whether this relationship is statistically significant, a Chi-square test should be conducted.

### 18.  Payment Method Preferences Across Cities:
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page20.png)

**Discussion:**
The query output shows that, overall, most cities prefer Cash on Delivery (COD), followed by Bkash and then Nagad. However, some city-specific variations are observed: residents of Dhaka prefer Bkash over COD, while Gazipur shows nearly equal usage of COD and Bkash. The use of Debit Card and Credit Card remains low across all cities.
