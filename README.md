## About the Project
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page2.png)

This project analyzes UrbanCart’s sales data using SQL to uncover actionable business insights related to revenue performance, product trends, and customer purchasing behavior. By querying transactional and dimensional data from tables such as fact_order, fact_order_items, dim_products, and dim_customers for the period from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2025, the analysis explores key questions including revenue distribution, top-performing and underperforming products, frequently purchased product combinations, customer ordering patterns, and drivers of order value. The objective is to evaluate overall sales performance, identify top products and customers, recognize emerging trends, and support data-driven business decision-making through insights on revenue, order quantity, and transaction patterns

**Discussion:**  
The ER diagram illustrates the database structure of the system by showing the main entities and their relationships. It includes entities such as Customers, Orders, Order_Items, and Products, where each entity represents a table in the database. The relationships indicate how customers place orders and how each order consists of multiple products. Primary keys uniquely identify each record, while foreign keys are used to maintain relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy.

### 1. Order Distribution

**Discussion:**  
Order Summary (September 30, 2025 – October 1, 2025)
During this period, UrbanCart recorded a total of 1,200 orders. Among them, 713 orders were successfully completed. The remaining 487 orders were not completed, with 241 orders still in a pending state and the rest having been cancelled.

**Discussion:**  
During this period, 100 unique customers placed orders on UrbanCart. Out of the 1,200 total orders, Barishal recorded the highest number (173), followed by Sylhet (148) and Chattogram (140), while the remaining orders were distributed across other cities.

### 4.The percentage of customers have placed more than one order & number of unique customers have placed at least one order

**Discussion:**  
The analysis indicates that all customers placed more than one order, reflecting a fully repeat-customer base and suggesting strong customer retention during the period. This behavior implies consistent engagement and satisfaction with the platform. However, the order volume trend shows a peak in October, followed by a slight decline in November and a more noticeable drop in December. This downward pattern may be influenced by seasonal effects, changing customer demand, or reduced promotional activity toward the end of the year, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to sustain order volume in later months.

### 5.The total revenue generated by UrbanCart 
![UrbanCart Sales Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaimurRah1/UrbanCart-Sales-Analytics-SQL-Based-Business-Insights/main/image/page7.png)

**Discussion:**
The analysis shows that UrbanCart generated a total revenue of 1,353,914 Taka from completed orders, providing a reliable measure of realized sales performance. By excluding pending and cancelled orders, this figure reflects actual cash-generating transactions. However, if all currently pending orders are successfully completed, total revenue is projected to rise to 1,789,715 Taka, indicating a substantial potential upside. This gap highlights the importance of efficient order fulfillment and follow-up processes, as converting pending orders into completed ones could significantly boost overall revenue without acquiring new customers.

### 6. Product categories that contribute the most to total revenue.

**Discussion:**
The chart highlights that the Fashion category is the top revenue generator for UrbanCart. This indicates that clothing, accessories, and related fashion items are the most popular and profitable products among customers. Several factors could explain this: fashion products often have higher price points compared to everyday items, frequent seasonal demand, and potential for upselling (e.g., matching items or bundles).

Following Fashion, Grocery and Electronics are the next highest revenue contributors. Grocery’s strong performance suggests high purchase frequency, as essential items are bought regularly. Electronics likely generate significant revenue due to higher individual product prices, even if purchase frequency is lower than groceries.

It’s important to note that this analysis considers only completed orders, which excludes canceled or returned orders. Therefore, the revenue figures reflect actual sales successfully processed rather than potential demand. This distinction is critical for decision-making, as it ensures the insights are grounded in real, realized revenue.
